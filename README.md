# KBot — RAG-Powered Intelligent Chatbot

> A Python + Flask chatbot system that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) via LlamaIndex and the OpenAI API to deliver accurate, context-grounded responses from a persistent knowledge base.

---

## Overview

KBot is a full-stack AI chatbot built with a Flask backend and a Next.js frontend. Rather than relying solely on a language model's parametric knowledge, KBot retrieves relevant context from a pre-indexed knowledge base before generating each response — significantly reducing hallucination and improving factual accuracy on domain-specific queries.

The RAG pipeline is powered by **LlamaIndex** for document indexing and semantic retrieval, and **OpenAI** for embedding generation and response synthesis. The index is persisted locally and loaded at query time, making the system lightweight and stateless per request.

**Achieved 80% query accuracy** against domain-specific ground-truth test queries.

```

**Request flow:**
1. User submits a query via the Next.js frontend
2. Frontend sends a `POST /response` request to the Flask backend
3. Flask loads the persisted LlamaIndex from `KBot Storage/`
4. LlamaIndex embeds the query and retrieves the most relevant context chunks
5. OpenAI generates a grounded response using the retrieved context
6. Response is returned as JSON and displayed in the UI

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Node.js 18+
- An OpenAI API key

---

### Backend Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/maham-a-awais/KBot.git
cd KBot

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create a .env file and add your OpenAI key
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here" > .env

# Run the Flask server
python app.py
```

The backend will start at `http://localhost:5000`.

---

### Frontend Setup

```bash
# Install Node dependencies
npm install

# Run the Next.js development server
npm run dev
```

The frontend will start at `http://localhost:3000`.

---

## API Reference

### `POST /response`

Send a query to the chatbot and receive a RAG-grounded response.

**Request body:**
```json
{
  "query": "Your question here"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "response": "KBot's answer based on retrieved context"
}
```

**Error (missing query):**
```json
{
  "error": "Query is required"
}
```

---

## How the RAG Pipeline Works

KBot uses LlamaIndex's `StorageContext` to load a pre-built vector index from the `KBot Storage/` directory at query time. This avoids rebuilding the index on each request and keeps the API stateless and fast.

```python
# From app.py — the core RAG query logic
storage_context = StorageContext.from_defaults(persist_dir="KBot Storage")
index = load_index_from_storage(storage_context)
query_engine = index.as_query_engine()
response = query_engine.query(query)
```

When a query arrives, LlamaIndex embeds it using OpenAI's embedding model, performs a semantic similarity search over the stored document vectors, retrieves the most relevant chunks, and passes them as context to the OpenAI LLM for grounded response generation.

---

## Research Relevance

Building KBot surfaced several open problems directly relevant to AI safety research:

- **Hallucination vs. grounding**: Without retrieved context, LLM responses were plausible but factually unreliable. With RAG, accuracy improved significantly but the 20% failure cases were the most instructive — they tended to involve partially relevant context that misled the model rather than absent context.
- **Evaluation difficulty**: Measuring 80% accuracy required building informal ground-truth benchmarks. Scaling this to larger or more ambiguous knowledge bases is a core unsolved problem in scalable oversight.
- **Prompt sensitivity**: Small changes to system prompts measurably changed retrieval quality and response faithfulness.
- **Context window trade-offs**: Adjusting chunk size and the number of retrieved chunks produced non-obvious effects on both accuracy and latency.

These observations motivate my interest in empirical AI safety research, particularly around scalable oversight, LLM evaluation methodology, and hallucination detection.
